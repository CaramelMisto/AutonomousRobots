***Autonomous Navigation Mobile Robot Simulation***

**Overview*
This repository contains the complete implementation of the Autonomous Navigation Mobile Robot Simulation project, created as part of the CEN449 Introduction to Autonomous Robots course. The project demonstrates the use of ROS and Gazebo to simulate TurtleBot 3 performing autonomous navigation without relying on a pre-saved map.

**Contents**
*All source code and configuration files used in the project.
*Simulation models and scripts for navigation and localization.
*Detailed project documentation, including insights into the implementation process and challenges faced.

**Video Presentation**
*The projectâ€™s video presentation has been uploaded to YouTube, showcasing:
The simulation environment.
Robot performance and navigation capabilities.
Key methods and findings from the project.
